### Company Name
GlobalTech Solutions Inc.

### Industry
Manufacturing

### Business Challenge
Our company is facing significant challenges with our legacy ERP system that was implemented 15 years ago. The system is struggling to handle our current transaction volume, lacks real-time reporting capabilities, and cannot integrate with modern cloud-based tools our departments are adopting. We're experiencing frequent system downtimes during peak hours, data silos between departments, and our IT team spends 70% of their time on maintenance rather than innovation. Additionally, our competitors are gaining market advantage through digital capabilities we cannot match with our current infrastructure.

### Current Technology Stack
- Core ERP: SAP R/3 (on-premises, version 4.7)
- Database: Oracle 11g
- Operating System: Windows Server 2012
- Integration: Custom-built middleware using Java 7
- Reporting: Crystal Reports and Excel-based manual processes
- Infrastructure: Physical servers in two data centers
- Development: ABAP for customizations, some .NET applications

### Project Type
ERP Modernization

### Project Duration
6-12 months

### Budget Range
$500K - $1M

### Success Criteria
Success will be measured by achieving 99.9% system uptime, reducing report generation time from hours to minutes, enabling real-time inventory visibility across all warehouses, achieving full integration with our Salesforce CRM and Microsoft 365 suite, reducing IT maintenance overhead by 50%, and providing mobile access to key functions for our field teams. We expect to see ROI within 18 months through operational efficiency gains and reduced infrastructure costs.
