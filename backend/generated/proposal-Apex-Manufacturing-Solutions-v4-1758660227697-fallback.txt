SOLUTION PROPOSAL FOR APEX MANUFACTURING SOLUTIONS V4
ERP Modernization Initiative
Generated: 9/23/2025

PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Our legacy ERP system (SAP R/3) is causing critical operational inefficiencies. We have zero real-time inventory visibility across our 3 manufacturing facilities, leading to overstock situations costing us $2M annually in carrying costs. Production planning is done manually with Excel spreadsheets, causing frequent stockouts that delay customer orders by an average of 12 days. Our quality control data is trapped in siloed systems, preventing us from identifying defect patterns until after products ship. The finance team spends 40+ hours monthly reconciling inventory discrepancies between systems. We need a modern, integrated solution to compete with industry leaders who are delivering 3x faster than us.

• Operating in the competitive Manufacturing industry where efficiency and innovation are critical

• Current technology stack (SAP R/3, Oracle 11g, Excel-based planning, standalone QC systems, custom .NET reporting tools) may be limiting operational agility

• Need to achieve: Real-time inventory visibility across all facilities, automated production planning reducing manual effort by 80%, integrated quality management system with predictive analytics, sub-5-day order fulfillment cycle, elimination of monthly inventory reconciliation, mobile access for plant floor supervisors, and ROI positive within 18 months through reduced carrying costs and improved customer satisfaction.

• Must deliver results within 6-12 months timeframe and Under $100K budget constraints

OVERVIEW (Confidence: 90%)
## Overview

Apex Manufacturing Solutions v4 operates in an increasingly competitive manufacturing landscape where operational agility and real-time visibility have become critical differentiators. While the company has built a solid foundation over the years, their current technology infrastructure—anchored by a 20+ year-old SAP R/3 system—is creating significant barriers to growth and operational excellence.

The core challenge facing Apex Manufacturing extends beyond typical system limitations to fundamental business performance issues. The lack of real-time inventory visibility across three manufacturing facilities is generating $2 million in annual carrying cost overruns, while manual Excel-based production planning contributes to 12-day average order delays—a performance gap that puts them at a severe disadvantage against industry leaders delivering three times faster. Additionally, siloed quality control systems prevent early defect pattern identification, and finance teams are dedicating over 40 hours monthly to inventory reconciliation activities that should be automated. These operational inefficiencies directly impact customer satisfaction, cash flow, and market competitiveness.

Apex Manufacturing's strategic objectives center on achieving operational excellence through real-time visibility, automated processes, and integrated quality management. The company seeks to reduce order fulfillment cycles to under five days, eliminate manual reconciliation processes, and achieve positive ROI within 18 months through reduced carrying costs and improved customer satisfaction. These goals reflect a broader transformation initiative designed to position the organization as a more agile, responsive manufacturing partner.

Presidio's proposed approach focuses on modernizing Apex Manufacturing's ERP infrastructure through a phased implementation that prioritizes high-impact, quick-win opportunities while building toward long-term operational transformation. Our solution strategy emphasizes seamless integration with existing systems where appropriate, modern cloud-based technologies for scalability, and mobile-enabled workflows that empower plant floor supervisors with real-time decision-making capabilities.

SOLUTION & APPROACH (Confidence: 90%)
# Solution & Approach

## High-Level Solution Architecture

Our proposed architectural approach centers on implementing a modern, cloud-based ERP platform that serves as the central nervous system for Apex Manufacturing's operations. The solution architecture emphasizes real-time data integration across all manufacturing facilities through a unified data layer, enabling immediate visibility into inventory levels, production status, and quality metrics. We anticipate leveraging a manufacturing-focused ERP solution with native IoT capabilities and advanced analytics, supported by a robust integration platform that can seamlessly connect with your existing Oracle database while gradually transitioning critical business processes away from the legacy SAP R/3 environment.

The technology strategy focuses on API-first architecture principles, enabling flexible integration with your current quality control systems and custom .NET reporting tools during the transition period. Our proposed approach includes implementing a modern data warehouse with real-time analytics capabilities, mobile-responsive interfaces for plant floor operations, and automated workflow engines for production planning. The integration strategy emphasizes minimizing disruption to ongoing operations through parallel system operation during critical phases, with carefully orchestrated data migration and validation processes that maintain business continuity while establishing the foundation for long-term operational excellence.

## Implementation Methodology

Our recommended implementation follows a phased delivery approach designed to deliver immediate business value while building toward the complete solution vision. The proposed first phase focuses on establishing real-time inventory visibility and basic production planning automation, targeting the most critical pain points that drive immediate ROI. Subsequent phases would introduce advanced quality management integration, mobile capabilities for supervisors, and sophisticated analytics for predictive insights. This staged approach allows for early wins that can fund continued investment while reducing overall project risk through incremental validation of system performance and user adoption.

The methodology incorporates agile principles with two-week sprint cycles, enabling continuous feedback and course correction throughout the implementation. Risk mitigation strategies include parallel testing environments, phased user training programs, and rollback procedures for each deployment stage. We anticipate conducting regular stakeholder reviews and maintaining close collaboration with your IT and operations teams to address emerging requirements and optimize system configuration. The iterative approach allows for real-world validation of each capability before proceeding to subsequent phases, reducing the likelihood of costly rework and supporting sustainable change management across your organization.

## Quality & Governance

Our quality assurance strategy encompasses multiple testing phases including unit testing, integration validation, user acceptance testing, and performance benchmarking against your specified success criteria. The proposed governance structure includes weekly progress reviews with key stakeholders, monthly steering committee meetings, and quarterly business value assessments to track progress toward ROI objectives. Communication protocols emphasize transparency and proactive issue escalation, with dedicated project management resources focused on coordinating activities across your three manufacturing facilities and maintaining alignment with operational requirements throughout the implementation lifecycle.
